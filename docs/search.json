We consider the simple case where p = 1; i.e. there is only one feature. Suppose that we have K classes, and that if an observation belongs to the kth class then X comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution, X ∼ N(µk, σ2k). Recall that the density function for the one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.16). Prove that in this case, the Bayes classifier is not linear.

This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when p is large. We will now investigate this curse.\n\n(A) Suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on p = 1 feature, X. We assume that X is uniformly (evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10 % of the range of X closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with X = 0.6, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?\n\nlibrary(data.table)\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nUnifDistVar1 <-\n  data.table(sample = 1:1000\n  )[, .(x1 = runif(1000)),\n    by = \"sample\"\n  ][, .(prop = mean(x1 %between% c(0.6 - 0.1/2, 0.6 + 0.1/2))),\n    by = \"sample\"]\n  \nmean(UnifDistVar1$prop)\n\n[1] 0.100297\n\n\n(B) Now suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on p = 2 features, X1 and X2. We assume that (X1, X2) are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10 % of the range of X1 and within 10 % of the range of X2 closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with X1 = 0.6 and X2 = 0.35, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for X1 and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for X2. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nUnifDistVar2 <-\n  UnifDistVar1[, .(x1 = runif(1000),\n                   x2 = runif(1000)),\n               by = \"sample\"\n  ][ , .(prop = mean(x1 %between% c(0.6 - 0.1/2, 0.6 + 0.1/2) &\n                     x2 %between% c(0.35 - 0.1/2, 0.35 + 0.1/2))),\n     by = \"sample\"]\n\nmean(UnifDistVar2$prop)\n\n[1] 0.009943\n\n\n(C) Now suppose that we have a set of observations on p = 100 features. Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations within the 10 % of each feature’s range that is closest to that test observation. What fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?\n\n0.1^100\n\n[1] 1e-100\n\n\n(D) Using your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.\nAs p gets lager every point has more specifications to meet and the number of point which meet them decrease.\n(E) Now suppose that we wish to make a prediction for a test observation by creating a p-dimensional hypercube centered around the test observation that contains, on average, 10% of the training observations. For p = 1, 2, and 100, what is the length of each side of the hypercube? Comment on your answer.\n\n\nWe now examine the differences between LDA and QDA.\n\n(A) If the Bayes decision boundary is linear, do we expect LDA or QDA to perform better on the training set?

Why?\nIf the Bayes decision boundary is non-linear, QDA could improve its test prediction accuracy as the sample size n increases. When the model has more examples it has less changes to overfit the data.\n(D) True or False: Even if the Bayes decision boundary for a given problem is linear, we will probably achieve a superior test error rate using QDA rather than LDA because QDA is flexible enough to model a linear decision boundary. Justify your answer.\nFALSE, as QDA would model some noise that could affect the prediction accuracy.\n\n\nSuppose we collect data for a group of students in a statistics class with variables X1 = hours studied, X2 = undergrad GPA, and Y = receive an A.
